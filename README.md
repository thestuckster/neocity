(Astro Tuf)[astro-turf.neocities.org] is my personal neocities site. Its purely a static HTML site with a windows 98 aesthetic. 
Any javascript is done purely with vanilla JS. 

To acheive the windows 98 look I am using (98.css)[https://github.com/jdan/98.css]

## What is neocities?

Even if you aren't old enough to have experienced geocities, you've probably heard about it from all the graybeards on the internet waxing poetic about
how things used to be. But if you haven't, Geocities was a webhosting site in the 90's for personal sites and was known for its crazy and choatic pages,
each site was organized into "cities" and user's would select a city that matched their sites theme. During its peak Geocities was one of the most visited
sites on the internet. 

(Neocities)[neocities.org] is a more modern recreation of Geocities to help bring back the invididual expression of the early internet days.
